# Classwork Repository for the CPS493_03 Web Programming class taught by professor Moshe Plotkin in the Fall 2020 semester.

My name is Myles Barcelo and I am currently a Computer Engineering &
Computer Science double major with a minor in Psychology. My history with computers
goes back to my childhood as I always spent my time playing around on old Windows
computers. My dive into computer science and engineering started in high school after I
took my first introductory computer science course with Professor Matthew Carlberg. I
was always interested in programming but Prof. Carlberg’s class made me fall in love
with computer science. I always got a different burst of happiness once I got a program
to work properly back then, and I still retain that feeling to this day whenever I work on
my projects. Since starting my undergraduate career, I have taken various classes that
taught me various different languages, but the ones I am most comfortable with are
Java, C/C++, Python, and Verilog. Being a part of the engineering department, most
classes involved me making some sort of project involving my code, but the most
7impactful projects I’ve made were a Nest-like remote thermostat system for Prof. Mike
Otis’s Embedded Systems class, and a temperature controlled Midi generator for Prof.

If I am being very honest, I do not know exactly where I can see myself using the
material I learned in this course—I just know that I will be reflecting on the lessons
learned from this class to help me solve problems in my career. I still do not really know
where I want to take my career beyond undergraduate college. I may want to work
within robotics and utilize this class to set up web server communications, or I may want
to work in game design and tap into the class material on a minimal level. I may even
change careers altogether, but I will still think like a programmer.  My options for where I
go are open, and I want to be equipped with the right skills to tackle any of them.
